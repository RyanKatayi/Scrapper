Our group and research

The research group in Cellular and Molecular Pediatrics is one among three interconnected research groups in Section of Comparative Pediatrics and Nutrition. The section offers a highly international, diverse and interdisciplinary environment, performing translational research and teaching related to physiology, immunology, microbiology, nutrition and diseases in both laboratory animals and human infants and children. The work extends from basic in vitro studies in cells and tissues (gut cell lines, primary blood and immune cells, and tissues) with various analytical techniques and omics technologies, to animal model studies (mainly in piglets) and intervention and cohort studies in infants at hospitals (exploring growth, gut, brain, immunity and microbiome).

In the research group of Cellular and Molecular Pediatrics, we focus on:  1) impact of perinatal complications (preterm birth, pre- and post-natal infection and inflammation) on immune development in early life; 2) Host, nutritional status and microbe interactions to determine health in early life; 3) Immune and metabolic mechanisms in neonatal infectious diseases (neonatal sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis) and novel therapeutic approaches. Our research platforms and tools are based on: 1) preterm pig model of neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis; 2) observational studies in human preterm infant cohorts; 3) multi-omic analyses (transcriptomics, proteomics, gut microbiome); 4) External collaborations with Danish and international hospitals/research centers working with newborn infants, neonatal mice and preterm lambs.

Project description

This PhD position will be a part of a project funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation within Basic Bioscience and Biomedicine. The overall aim of the project is to explore how early life nutrition and Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine can prevent sepsis and mortality in infected newborns. Every year, millions of newborn infants, especially those born prematurely, die due to infection during the first month of life. In low-income settings including Africa, BCG vaccine administered shortly after birth in low-birth-weight infants confers protective effects against neonatal infection and all-cause mortality. This protective effect is beyond the specific protection of tuberculosis that BCG is supposed to target via adaptive immunity. This has contributed to the discovery of non-specific effects of vaccines. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) is still hesitant to recommend BCG vaccine shortly after birth for all newborn infants due to unclear mechanisms of protection, especially how BCG affects innate immunity in preterm infants. Further, it is unknown if early life nutrition has any contributing effects to how BCG alters newborn innate immunity. Our research group has established a unique model of neonatal sepsis in preterm piglets and found that there is an interplay between immunity and systemic metabolism to determine the immune response and clinical outcomes in infected newborns (https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/157234). We also found that early life nutrition massively influences host metabolism and sepsis outcomes in infected animals. In this project, the PhD candidate will explore how BCG vaccine affects innate immune development in newborn animals, how and why it confers sepsis protective effects and whether early life nutrition contributes to this protection. The project will include a close collaboration with Prof. Tobias Kollmann and Dr. Nelly Amenyogbe (Dalhousie University).

The current position will mainly focus on animal studies and laboratory analyses within this project, including animal study execution and various tissue analyses (FACS, qPCR, transcriptomics and metabolomics). Depending on the competence and ambition, the candidate can also be involved in various sub-projects related to microbiome interventions using various animal models of infection and inflammation.

"Postdoctoral Research in Vaccine Production, NIH Maryland, United States","Maryland ,United States","As part of the NIH’s Vaccine Research Center, the Vaccine Production Program (VPP) serves to translate drug discoveries to clinical manufacturing to advance public health. The VPP is a science-driven organization uniquely positioned between academia and the biopharmaceutical industry. Research at the VPP combines the rigor of academic studies with cutting-edge development. Specialized teams of scientists and engineers work in close collaboration with each other, with other labs and programs within the VRC and the NIH, as well as with academic and industry partners. Through our collaborative environment, the postdoctoral fellow will advance their academic careers while gaining valuable experience in biopharmaceutical process development.

Research in Upstream Process Development centers on the identification and optimization of process parameters to support and control the growth of a mammalian or microbial cell line in a production bioreactor. The resulting process must ensure a robust and scalable method to deliver high-yielding expression of the recombinant vaccine, monoclonal antibody, or other protein of interest. Development begins with automated microbioreactors (15 to 250 mL) and progressively increases from 3 L bench-scale bioreactors up to a scale of 50 L. The finalized processes are then transferred externally to enable larger scale manufacturing of clinical material under cGMP regulations.

We are seeking a motivated postdoctoral candidate to apply advanced experimental and computational techniques towards improving cell growth, productivity, and metabolism. A successful candidate will have a keen interest in multidisciplinary work that challenges and expands their scientific abilities. The candidate will choose from a handful of related projects based on their interests and career goals. Broadly, the candidate will develop and evaluate novel media compositions, supplementation, and feeding strategies to optimize our development process. Postdoctoral fellows can also develop their own research initiatives within the mission of the VPP using the wealth of data from prior and ongoing development runs.

Applicants with related experience are encouraged to apply even if they do not have prior experience in mammalian cell culture, metabolism, or computational biology. Our interdisciplinary program is designed to provide experiences that foster the development of skills necessary to conduct independent research and to cross-train fellows in related disciplines such as cell culture development, bioreactor operation, metabolomics, machine learning, computational biology, and statistics.

Eligibility 

Candidates must have a PhD in biological engineering, chemical engineering, computational biology, or a related field. Have one or more first-author publications in high quality journals. Experience with the mammalian cell culture, bioreactor modeling, and metabolomics. OR Experience with computational biology, specifically metabolic modeling, and machine learning Practical understanding of statistical analysis Ability to work independently and on a team Experience mentoring junior scientists Effective oral and written communication

Through our collaborative environment, the postdoctoral fellow will advance their academic careers while gaining valuable experience in biopharmaceutical process development.

Research in Upstream Process Development centers on the identification and optimization of process parameters to support and control the growth of a mammalian or microbial cell line in a production bioreactor. The resulting process must ensure a robust and scalable method to deliver high-yielding expression of the recombinant vaccine, monoclonal antibody, or other protein of interest. Development begins with automated microbioreactors (15 to 250 mL) and progressively increases from 3 L bench-scale bioreactors up to a scale of 50 L. The finalized processes are then transferred externally to enable larger scale manufacturing of clinical material under cGMP regulations.

We are seeking a motivated postdoctoral candidate to apply advanced experimental and computational techniques towards improving cell growth, productivity, and metabolism. A successful candidate will have a keen interest in multidisciplinary work that challenges and expands their scientific abilities. The candidate will choose from a handful of related projects based on their interests and career goals. Broadly, the candidate will develop and evaluate novel media compositions, supplementation, and feeding strategies to optimize our development process.

"Postdoctoral Position in Nanotechnology  Uppsala University, Sweden","Stockholm ,Sweden","The Division of Nanotechnology and Functional Materials is part of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ångström Laboratory. At the division, we conduct research within functional porous materials for energy and environmental applications, nano biomaterials, sustainable electrical energy storage and energy transformations, functionalization of electrode surfaces for catalytic applications, additive manufacturing of pharmaceutical materials, microsensors for in vivo usage and sustainable materials from biomass. Researchers here thus have extensive experience in the functionalization of biomaterials, biocompatibility, diagnostics, additive manufacturing, organic energy storage, nanosafety and the development and characterization of functional porous materials.

 

The project is about the development of nanostructured materials, with a keen focus on 3D architectures such as foams, membranes, and others from a variety of biomass-derived polymers. These polymers, sourced from marine, agricultural, and food biomass, represent a renewable and eco-friendly feedstock that align with the principles of green chemistry and sustainability. The core of the research endeavor is not only to synthesize these innovative materials but also to strategically modify them by introducing functional groups and ligands. Such modifications are aimed at enhancing the materials' capabilities to selectively adsorb and remove a wide spectrum of organic and inorganic contaminants from water, soil and sediments. This combination of the design of advanced materials with chemical functionalization is a promising way to advance current water remediation technologies

"PhD Scholarship in Machine Learning, City University of London, United Kingdom","London ,United Kingdom","Modern deep learning techniques achieve human-like performance in many medical image analysis tasks, including the identification of anomalous tissue/pathology from medical scans. To be trained, these techniques typically require large image datasets with pixel-level annotations provided by medical experts. However, obtaining reliable annotations is very difficult (due to the intrinsic nature of the task, especially for rare/complex pathologies) and highly time-consuming. This severely hinders the development and deployment of AI into clinical practice, despite its huge potential. 

This PhD Scholarship will focus on designing novel approaches that require less detailed/reliable annotations but are still capable of producing highly accurate results. These approaches will include training models through weak supervision (i.e. leveraging only coarse annotations provided by the experts) and incorporating noise-robust learning strategies (i.e. accounting for the presence of unreliable annotations). We expect that many high-impact publications will be generated during the project, to be presented both in computer science-related venues (e.g. CVPR, NeurIPS, MICCAI) as well as at medical conferences (e.g. ISMRM, ESMRMB).

Outstanding PhD candidates will be offered fee waiver and a tax-free scholarship of €22,000 per annum for four years. All applicants (including international applicants) will be automatically considered for funded studentships.

The PhD candidate will work on a research project titled Islamist movements in exile. This assesses the evolution of activism of moderate Islamist social movements in exile in Europe since the so-called “Arab Spring”. Following the 2010-11 MENA uprisings, Islamists fell victim to renewed regime repression in many countries and were forced to flee, with high numbers relocating to Turkey, Malaysia, the US, and Europe. Since then, Islamists have worked to rebuilding unity under exile while also trying to settle into their new reality in host societies. This led to the creation of new Islamist diasporas and pressure groups whose impact on European political landscapes and societies has only started to be researched. Significantly, the dimension of forced exile is leading many Islamists to question their pre-held beliefs and belonging, resulting in challenges against established hierarchies, values, and practices. These processes have started to generate internal change, which is likely to considerably reshape Islamist movements, their activism, political mobilization, identity, value system, and engagement with host societies. However, despite their growing presence within European contexts, Islamist diasporic movements remain largely understudied.

Priority will be given to projects that propose to investigate aspects of the above noted dynamics to moderate Islamist movements in European countries such as Ireland, the UK, Italy, France, Belgium, and Turkey; that apply or include a gender dimension; that adopt a comparative approach either between host countries or between host and home country. Candidates whose interest is on MENA Islamist social movements in exile in Southeast Asia are also encouraged to apply.

We publish our work in world-class scientific journals and regularly present at important international conferences.

Around 52 people per day suffer a stroke in Belgium, of whom one third is affected by aphasia, an acquired and impactful language disorder. In the acute phase, formal language testing is challenging, due to potential co-morbid cognitive problems, leading to inaccurate diagnoses and predictions. Natural speech assessment is less depended on active cooperation and would be more representative for daily communication. Therefore, in a large-scale longitudinal project in stroke patients (n=600), we will optimize the standard screening protocol by including natural speech production tasks and a more extensive characterization of the lesion. Via data-driven clustering techniques we will define different profiles in the acute phase and test their predictive value in terms of long-term language outcomes. Second, we will examine natural speech reception in a subset of 100 acute stroke patients and neurotypical controls by testing the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of EEG neural tracking (i.e., an EEG technique that links brain responses to specific acoustic and linguistic features encompassed within the natural story patients listened to). By using natural speech measures, the aim is to provide novel way to diagnose aphasia in a more comprehensive and functionally relevant manner.
